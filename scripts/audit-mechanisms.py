"""Which mechanisms have been instantiated for which protocols.

`docs/target-properties.md` part 2 claims that a rule showing the
properties composes with *each mechanism* with no further proof.
`audit-conformance.py` says which rules show which properties;
`audit-bespoke.py` says that no mechanism theorem reaches a protocol
outside them. Neither says whether a mechanism has ever been *applied*
to a rule — and it cannot, because a cell nobody wrote leaves no code
behind. Both audits check what exists; this one checks what does not.

A cell is:

* `yes`  — some declaration applies one of the mechanism's generic
           theorems and names one of the rule's carriers; or, for the
           cut, the fill and re-genesis, the carrier has a
           `DagRule.OnRecord` instance, since every verdict cell of
           those three mechanisms is `Properties/Arcs/Record.lean` at
           such an instance and nothing is written per cell;
* `open` — the rule shows everything the mechanism asks for and no such
           declaration exists. That is the gap this audit is for: not a
           defect, but work the properties have already paid for and
           nobody has collected;
* `--`   — the rule does not show what the mechanism asks for, which is
           `audit-conformance.py`'s business and not repeated here.

Reads `docs/depgraph/deps.tsv` and `docs/decls.json`; regenerate both
before trusting a run. Reports only — an uncollected cell is work
outstanding rather than a defect.
